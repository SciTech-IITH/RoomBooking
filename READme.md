# Version 2 : by Armaan
PyPdf2 was deprecated so switched to a new version PyPdf only.
Just run - and use it. (https://pypi.org/project/pypdf/#history)
```
pip install pypdf
```

# Purpose
1. To quickly generate the Documents needed by the Gymkhana and the Room Booking
   office to book a room.


# Instructions
1. Edit only line-3 to line-21
2. The coordinates of the entiries are locked in so dont change those numbers
3. When running for the first time, edit only `rb.pdf` and attach your signature and again store it forever as a dummy to reuse. Then run the program after you edit the details session/meeting wise.


# Method
1. Generate both the pdfs
2. Send it to the secy via mail with the content being something very basic - `Dear Secy, we request you to please book ALH1 on <date> for the slot <slot>. 
3. I would then forward these to FIC and RB with the club in CC and seek approvals in that particular order.
4. After FIC approves, I would forward the approval and the pdfs to RB Office.
5. Finally, RB Office would make the room booking
